# Conversational AI BOT

## Project Overview
This project is a Conversational AI bot designed to provide information about historical monuments worldwide. The chatbot can answer user queries related to historical sites and also includes an OTP-based email verification system within the conversation flow.

## Features
- **Conversational AI:** Users can ask about historical monuments, and the bot provides relevant responses.
- **Agentic Workflow:** Implemented using LangGraph to structure the conversation.
- **OTP Verification:** The bot requests and verifies the userâ€™s email via a 6-digit OTP sent using SendGrid.
- **LLM Integration:** Uses Groq's `Gemma2-9b-It` model for response generation.
- **Keyword-Based Email Trigger:** If certain travel-related keywords appear in user queries, the bot prompts for an email to send additional details.

## Tech Stack
- **LLM Framework:** LangGraph + Groq
- **OTP Service:** SendGrid
- **Development Environment:** VS Code
- **Configuration Management:** `config.ini` file to store API keys

## How It Works
1. User starts a conversation and asks about historical monuments.
2. The bot responds with relevant monument details.
3. If the user's query suggests interest in travel recommendations, the bot asks for their email.
4. If the user provides an email, the bot generates a 6-digit OTP and sends it using SendGrid.
5. The user enters the OTP in the chat for verification.
6. Upon successful verification, the bot confirms that details will be sent via email.
